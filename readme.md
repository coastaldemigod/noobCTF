### A platform to host CTFs, a CLI-based, retro themed CTF hosting platform.

### How to run

Go to src folder
Then run these commands to start the app

```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```

As of now, the client-side of the app is fully functional, i.e. once started, you can login, register, participate and submit solutions to contests/ctfs. The data about the contests itself has to be added to the JSON database manually. I am working on the host-side of the app, from where you can add contests to the plaform and collect data about the participants when the contest is over.
